[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

```python
CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)
```
>> The calculated effect is .08 standard deviations. That is not huge but it is more than the impact on pregnancy time.
